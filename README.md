# React application

CodeCademy front-end engineer course project. The purpose of this assignment was to use React Router to improve the one-page application user experience. The structure, content and styling were provided by CodeCademy but setting up the Router and its functionality was by me. By completing this exercise I got some good practice in how React and React Router work.
